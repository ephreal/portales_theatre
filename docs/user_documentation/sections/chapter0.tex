\section*{Introduction}
Welcome to the documentation for Los Portales Theatre's Website. This documentation is split into two parts: Administration and Usage.

Administration covers site requirements, setup, maintenance, and migration.

Usage covers how to use the software, both from an administrative user's perspective and from a non-admin's perspective.

This documentation can be distributed either in electronic format or printed out and sent to any location that requires it.
